This program demonstrates the use of the Epiphay on the Parallella computer for image processing. The package includes a noise-imposed image, "lenna.jpg". By default, the program loads this image, and filters the high-frequency noise, generating a clean file "lenna.lpf.jpg". For reference, the resulting image is "lenna.lpf.ref.jpg".

The program uses the DevIL library for reading and writing the image file from/to the storage. After reading the file, the pixel data is extracted and loaded to the Epiphnay, where the filter program is running.

To install DevIL on Linux, type:

>> sudo apt-get install libdevil-dev
>> sudo apt-get install libdevil1c2


Timing measuremenst of the various parts is displayed after the calculation concludes.


For performnace reference, an implementation of 2D-FFT transform of the same size is provided. The reference utilizes the FFTW library, which is considered a best-in-class library for DFT calculations. We used an ARM port for the FFTW. This version can be foud here:
